# AutocleanEEG Task Registry

This repository is the public catalogue of EEG task templates for the AutocleanEEG ecosystem. Each task describes a complete preprocessing pipeline â€“ the same collection of templates you see inside the Task Wizard and can install with the AutocleanEEG commandâ€‘line tools.

## How this registry helps you

### 1. Use the Task Wizard (recommended)
- Go to **https://taskwizard.autocleaneeg.org**.
- Stepâ€¯1 shows the official templates from this registry â€“ pick one or start from scratch.
- Configure the task, preview the Python output, then either download it or publish it back here with a single click.

### 2. Install templates with the AutocleanEEG CLI
Once a task is published (or updated) in this registry, you can pull it straight into your local pipeline:
```bash
autocleaneeg-pipeline task library update
autocleaneeg-pipeline task library list            # optional, view what is available
autocleaneeg-pipeline task library install <TaskName>
```
This saves `tasks/<TaskName>.py` into your project, ready for import.

### 3. Download a task directly
Prefer to grab a file manually?
- Browse `tasks/<category>/<TaskName>.py` in this repo and download the file.
- Or fetch from raw GitHub, e.g.:
  ```bash
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cincibrainlab/autocleaneeg-task-registry/main/tasks/resting/RestingEyesOpen.py
  ```

### 4. Inspect the index
All published tasks are listed in [`registry.json`](registry.json). Each entry maps a task name to its file path; downstream tools (Task Wizard, CLI) read this file to stay in sync.

## Whatâ€™s inside the repository?
```
â”œâ”€â”€ registry.json          # master index of task names and locations
â””â”€â”€ tasks/                 # task implementations grouped by category
    â”œâ”€â”€ resting/
    â”œâ”€â”€ auditory/
    â””â”€â”€ â€¦
```
Sample tasks include:

| Task | Category | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| `RestingEyesOpen`  | resting  | Baseline eyes-open resting-state pipeline |
| `RestingEyesClosed`| resting  | Eyes-closed variant with matching preprocessing |
| `ASSR_40Hz`        | auditory | Auditory steady-state response experiment |
| `MMN_Standard`     | auditory | Mismatch negativity paradigm |
| `BiotrialResting1020` | resting | Resting-state workflow tuned for 10-20 layouts |

## Contributing a new task
The simplest path is through the Task Wizard: configure your task, run a **dry run**, then **Publish to Registry**. The wizard will open a pull request here for review.

If you need to submit manually:
1. Add `tasks/<category>/<TaskName>.py` (PascalCase, matches the class name).
2. Add the corresponding entry to `registry.json`.
3. Open a pull request targeting `main` with a short description of the task and any validation notes.

## Need help?
Reach out on the lab Slack or open an issue on GitHub. Let us know which task youâ€™re working with and whether youâ€™re using the Task Wizard or the CLI so we can point you in the right direction quickly.

Happy preprocessing! ðŸ§
